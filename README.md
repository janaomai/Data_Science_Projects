### Project: Machine Learning Modelling - Spam Detection
**Author**: Jana Omaiche

This project implements a machine learning model to detect spam in SMS messages using classifiers K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees. 
The dataset is preprocessed, analysed, and balanced using SMOTE to address class imbalance. Different metrics, including accuracy and balanced accuracy, are used to compare the performance of models, both with and without SMOTE.

### Project: Data Modelling Report - Employee Retention
**Author**: Jana Omaiche

This project involves clustering techniques applied to a dataset of employees at a company struggling with employee retention. 
It explores both K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms to identify patterns and groupings within the data. 
The project includes extensive data visualisation for both single-variable and paired-variable relationships, along with an elbow method analysis to determine optimal clusters for K-Means.

### Project: Data Analysis: New Streaming Engine Alrogithm
**Author**: Jana Omaiche

This project involves analysing the WNW New Engine Algorithm's performance using a dataset of streaming data. 
Various statistical methods were applied, including cleaning the dataset, assessing normality, performing simple and multiple linear regression analyses, and conducting A/B testing. 
The goal was to determine how different variables influence user engagement and assess the impact of a new engine algorithm.
